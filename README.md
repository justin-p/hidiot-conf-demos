# hidiot-conf-demos
HIDIOT Demos for various conferences.

This Repo will be updated with new demos for each event. One day, some of these may even turn into fully supported projects.

Please bear in mind these are demos, and are not functional tutorials, nor are you meant to run them on your HIDIOT.

**Running this code on your HIDIOT could kill your USB bus, your computer, your electronics or you. Don't run these. We accept no responsibility for any damage incurred by running this code**

Having said that, by all means peruse the (terrible) code.
